    <h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    Ever since I was a child I have had a strong interest in computers.<br> 
    From the age of 8 years old I managed to build my own PC while other kids would be playing outside.<br> 
    I would be attending computer fairs and spending hours in my room making my PC as high spec as possible.<br>
    From this I decided to attend a ICT Practitioners Diploma in college,<br>
    however my financial situation proved difficult so I had to put my aspirations on hold and enter the working world.<br>
    I ended up working in the finance sector for Royal Bank of Scotland,<br> 
    however as time went on I began to regret my past decisions as I wasn’t working in a role I was passionate about.<br>
    Shortly after I discovered CodeNation which really peaked my interest as I had a lot of experience in the hardware side of computers,but not the software side.<br> 
    I’ve found since that coding is a natural fit for me, I enjoy problem solving, working within a team and seeing the end product of my work.<br> 
    It gives a certain sense of satisfaction that I haven’t had since I was young, building computers.<br>

        <h3 id="it">The purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>
        In a 24 hour society time has become critical.<br> 
        We simply do not have enough hours in the day to achieve everything that we want to.<br> 
        As a result IT has become crucial to all aspects of our daily lives.<br>
        We order our shopping online, use ticket machines for our travel, even keep in touch with friends and family online, all in an effort to save time.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        The same applies for business, as time is money.<br>
        The more efficient a business, the higher the turnover, this is where IT becomes essential.<br>
        With technology marketing has become both easier and more successful,<br> 
        able to reach a wider range of customers with minimal effort.<br>
        Businesses are now better able to make decisions based on solid market research which previously wasn’t available.<br>
        Planning has become easier with tools such as kanban boards to solve complex problems,<br>
        which are easily accessible from work or at home, making organizing and delegating tasks easier.<br>
        Many businesses are now able to offer 24/7 support through web chat services that were previously unavailable.<br> 
        This allows businesses to maintain good customer relations with their customers.<br>
        Resource management has improved through IT, now users are able to access software from Cloud storage.<br>

    <h3 id="project">What's needed to make a project successful?</h3>
    <p>
    To successfully design a project, planning is essential which is made easier with kanban tools such as trello.<br> 
    Trello allows you to set goals, assign individual tasks and have a general overview of where you are up to and what needs to be done with the project.<br>
    This allows for clear project goals, and for the design team to know their purpose and what they’re working towards.<br>
    Communication is also key, a good way to keep in contact with your colleagues is slack.<br> 
    Slack can easily be integrated with trello to provide you with updates whenever a task has been set or completed.<br>
    This allows a project manager to assign resources to each individual task, allowing them to more effectively lead a team.<br>

    <p>
    As the link above shows I can start firstly by brainstorming different ideas of features I would like to implement in my website,<br> 
    once I’m happy that i’ve included enough content I can then filter through the list to pick out the best ideas.<br> 
    Then remove those that may be too difficult to implement or not relevant enough to the project.<br>
    The next step would then be to assign the individual tasks to colleagues given their individual skillset,<br> 
    I can easily make sure that the best person for each task is suitable.<br>
    The progress then can be monitored so we can clearly see where we have had success and failures,<br> 
    allowing me to pool resources wherever needed.<br>

    <h3 id ="fail">What causes digital projects to fail?</h3>
    <p>
    Over Ambition can cause projects to fail, often companies seek perfection in the project that can cause significant delays to the release date,<br>
    causing the cost of development to exceed the given budget, in more severe cases it can even drive a company into bankruptcy.<br>
    This is caused by lack of planning and not acknowledging the limits of what you can do, it’s expectation vs reality.<br> 
    A project also needs to be flexible to adapt to changes in the business or market, what we need today may not essentially be what we need tomorrow,<br>
    projects fail or are cancelled due to this reason, which is why planning in the early stages is essential.<br>

    <h3 id ="technology">Selecting the right technology for the job</h3>
    <p>
    It is important to firstly know what you’re trying to achieve,<br> 
    what your end goal is, from there you can research every tool that you need to complete the job.<br> 
    Will I be creating something that solely works on iOS?<br>
    Do I have members in my team with the correct skillset to be able to code for that platform?<br> 
    Is there a more efficient and cost effective way of building the application?<br> 
    What is my customer base and their requirements?<br>
    This applies for every project as it’s essential to start correctly, mistakes cost the business money, and can inevitably lead to projects failing.<br>

    <h3 id ="chosen">How chosen technologies help me achieve my outcomes</h3>
    <p>
    Trello allows me to put all my ideas securely in one location,<br> 
    from there I can manage the viable ideas into tasks and assign them to different team members.<br> 
    As the project develops I can clearly see the progress and what needs to be done.<br>
    In Github there is a facility called version control, this helps me identify what changes have been made and by who,<br> 
    it also allows teams to work on projects together knowing that they can contribute code,<br> 
    test and fix bugs knowing that any version can be recovered at any time if needed.<br>

    <h3 id ="legal">Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
    <p>
    General Data Protection Regulation came into effect May 25th 2018,<br> 
    which means any personal data such as names, email addresses, photos, residential address, bank details, medical information, IP addresses are all protected.<br> 
    Given customers the right to:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Access - Meaning they can request information on how there data is being used.</li>
    <li>To be forgotton - If the customer no longer wishes to be affiliated with the company</li>
    <li>Data portability - To transfer there information to a different company</li>
    <li>Customers are to be informed before data is collected on them.</li>
    <li>The right to have data corrected if it’s incorrect.</li>
    <li>Restrict processing so companies can store their information but not use it.</li>
    <li>The right to object to their data being used for marketing purposes</li>
    <li>The right to be notified of any data breaches.</li>
    </ul>
    This means that companies have to be more vigilant than ever during market research which is essential to any digital project, or they could risk facing heavy fines that could negatively impact their business

          <h3 id="build">How I built the website</h3>
          <p>
                I decided as my website was going to be a blog that it would be helpful to have everything on the same page.<br>
                This meant I had one page with a lot of content and in order to make it more user friendly I decided to use a jump link for each section of the page.<br>
                I used visual studio code for the actual coding of the website, by using HTML, it allowed me space out sentences properly, assign paragraphs and even add bullet points.<br>
                The next step was to add images underneath each paragraph to add some colour to the website.<br>
                Once I had the general lay out of the website and content filled in I could then move to using CSS to style the website,<br> 
                adding background colour and changing the overall look of the website.<br>
                A great place learn how to code in HTML and CSS is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>
          </p>
                <h4>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h4>
            <p>
                Copyright means the right to re-produce work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies,<br>
                to perform the work, and display the work publically.<br>
                If you are using content that has been copyrighted and you don't legally have the right to use the content you can be fined<br>
                A good way to avoid any copy right issues is when using google to find images you can change the settings to filter out copyrighted images.<br>
                When quoting from a website it is always a good idea to include a link to their website as well.<br>

                <h4>How people with disabilities use the web</h4>
                <p>
                People who are blind often use screen readers that reads the text on the screen, or refreshable braile displays, we can help them by using text based browsers rather than graphical browsers.<br>
                However people with low vision can be helped by increasing our text font size and making sure we use colors that stand out, so our text is not similiar to our background<br>
                The same applies to people with colour blindness, making sure we are not using similar colours as it'll make it difficult for them tl read.<br>
                Seizure disorders can be a common problem when using websites that have flickering gifs or sudden flashes.<br>
                I used still images for this reason rather than moving gifs to make it more accessible.<br>
                Also people with psychriatic disabilities have trouble focusing so I made sure there was no distracting visual or audio elements to my site<br>

                </p>
                <h4>File types suitable for websites</h4>
                To build the structure of the website and to add content I used HTML.<br>
                To add images to my website I used common image file types to make sure that there was no errors,<br>
                the image types I used was jpeg, png and gif. It's important to use common file types as some can not be supported on websites<br>
                Finally I used CSS to style the website which enabled me to change the alignment, add background colours and change the font.<br>
                <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html#rar">More information on each type can be found here</a>

                <h4>Outcome 2</h4><br>
                <p>I found the use of trello extremely helpful as I could store my content there and recover it when needed.<br>
                When starting a new day I can look back on trello to see what tasks have been completed and what is needed to be done,<br>
                this helps alot with planning and time management.<br>
                For the actual coding I used Visual Studio Code which i've found easy to use, the program identifys where you have made mistakes,<br>
                and even in some cases helps you to fix them.
                I found both programs extremely effective and they helped me complete my tasks.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The main strength of my website is that it's simple and easy to use for everyone, the black text is easily readable against the light background,<br>
               which means even people who have visual impairment should be able to read it, I also made the size bigger to help it become clear.<br>
               The main weakness of the website is I feel it could of been more aesthetically pleasing, as I went for simplicity rather than beauty.<br>
               I would most likely change the background to be a scenic image, perhaps have the text in boxes so it looks neater.<br>
               I also would use buttons rather than links as it looks neater, and are more relevant<br>
               Overall I feel the outcome of my website was successful, it's easy to navigate and all information is clearly highlighted and easy to read<br> </p>
            </p>
            <h4>Outcome 3</h4>
            <p>If I was to build the website again I feel I would be more effecient as I now have a better understanding of HTML and CSS.<br>
               I now have a better understanding of where to use div's, paragraphs and line breaks,<br>
               resizing headers and making lists. The draw back to this is it takes time to make sure everything is spaced correctly.<br>
               As for writing I'm used to using Microsoft Word which does everything for you.<br>
               It would of been alot easier to work in teams as my weaknesses or gaps in knowledge could of been someone else's strength.<br>
               In a team we would be able to brainstorm ideas then assign individuals tasks depending on their strengths using trello,<br>
               We could then link trello to slack so we can effectively communicate and receive updates once tasks have been completed.</p>
               When the site has been completed I would then test it on different browsers to make sure its working correctly,<br>
               I would also ask colleagues to test it and note down any feedback given, if it was possible I would also like to see how people with disabilities use the website.<br>
               This would enable me to make it more user friendly if needed.<br>
