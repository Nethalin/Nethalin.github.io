<p>
    Ever since I was a child I have had a strong interest in computers.<br> 
    From the age of 8 years old I managed to build my own PC while other kids would be playing outside.<br> 
    I would be attending computer fairs and spending hours in my room making my PC as high spec as possible.<br>
    From this I decided to attend a ICT Practitioners Diploma in college,<br>
    however my financial situation proved difficult so I had to put my aspirations on hold and enter the working world.<br>
    I ended up working in the finance sector for Royal Bank of Scotland,<br> 
    however as time went on I began to regret my past decisions as I wasn’t working in a role I was passionate about.<br>
    Shortly after I discovered CodeNation which really peaked my interest as I had a lot of experience in the hardware side of computers,but not the software side.<br> 
    I’ve found since that coding is a natural fit for me, I enjoy problem solving, working within a team and seeing the end product of my work.<br> 
    It gives a certain sense of satisfaction that I haven’t had since I was young, building computers.<br>

        <h3 id="it">The purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>
        In a 24 hour society time has become critical.<br> 
        We simply do not have enough hours in the day to achieve everything that we want to.<br> 
        As a result IT has become crucial to all aspects of our daily lives.<br>
        We order our shopping online, use ticket machines for our travel, even keep in touch with friends and family online, all in an effort to save time.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        The same applies for business, as time is money.<br>
        The more efficient a business, the higher the turnover, this is where IT becomes essential.<br>
        With technology marketing has become both easier and more successful,<br> 
        able to reach a wider range of customers with minimal effort.<br>
        Businesses are now better able to make decisions based on solid market research which previously wasn’t available.<br>
        Planning has become easier with tools such as kanban boards to solve complex problems,<br>
        which are easily accessible from work or at home, making organizing and delegating tasks easier.<br>
        Many businesses are now able to offer 24/7 support through web chat services that were previously unavailable.<br> 
        This allows businesses to maintain good customer relations with their customers.<br>
        Resource management has improved through IT, now users are able to access software from Cloud storage.<br>

    <h3 id="project">What's needed to make a project successful?</h3>
    <p>
    To successfully design a project, planning is essential which is made easier with kanban tools such as trello.<br> 
    Trello allows you to set goals, assign individual tasks and have a general overview of where you are up to and what needs to be done with the project.<br>
    This allows for clear project goals, and for the design team to know their purpose and what they’re working towards.<br>
    Communication is also key, a good way to keep in contact with your colleagues is slack.<br> 
    Slack can easily be integrated with trello to provide you with updates whenever a task has been set or completed.<br>
    This allows a project manager to assign resources to each individual task, allowing them to more effectively lead a team.<br>

    <p>
    As the link above shows I can start firstly by brainstorming different ideas of features I would like to implement in my website,<br> 
    once I’m happy that i’ve included enough content I can then filter through the list to pick out the best ideas.<br> 
    Then remove those that may be too difficult to implement or not relevant enough to the project.<br>
    The next step would then be to assign the individual tasks to colleagues given their individual skillset,<br> 
    I can easily make sure that the best person for each task is suitable.<br>
    The progress then can be monitored so we can clearly see where we have had success and failures,<br> 
    allowing me to pool resources wherever needed.<br>

    <h3 id ="fail">What causes digital projects to fail?</h3>
    <p>
    Over Ambition can cause projects to fail, often companies seek perfection in the project that can cause significant delays to the release date,<br>
    causing the cost of development to exceed the given budget, in more severe cases it can even drive a company into bankruptcy.<br>
    This is caused by lack of planning and not acknowledging the limits of what you can do, it’s expectation vs reality.<br> 
    A project also needs to be flexible to adapt to changes in the business or market, what we need today may not essentially be what we need tomorrow,<br>
    projects fail or are cancelled due to this reason, which is why planning in the early stages is essential.<br>

    <h3 id ="technology">Selecting the right technology for the job</h3>
    <p>
    It is important to firstly know what you’re trying to achieve,<br> 
    what your end goal is, from there you can research every tool that you need to complete the job.<br> 
    Will I be creating something that solely works on iOS?<br>
    Do I have members in my team with the correct skillset to be able to code for that platform?<br> 
    Is there a more efficient and cost effective way of building the application?<br> 
    What is my customer base and their requirements?<br>
    This applies for every project as it’s essential to start correctly, mistakes cost the business money, and can inevitably lead to projects failing.<br>

    <h3 id ="chosen">How chosen technologies help me achieve my outcomes</h3>
    <p>
    Trello allows me to put all my ideas securely in one location,<br> 
    from there I can manage the viable ideas into tasks and assign them to different team members.<br> 
    As the project develops I can clearly see the progress and what needs to be done.<br>
    In Github there is a facility called version control, this helps me identify what changes have been made and by who,<br> 
    it also allows teams to work on projects together knowing that they can contribute code,<br> 
    test and fix bugs knowing that any version can be recovered at any time if needed.<br>

          <h3 id="build">How I built the website</h3>
          <p>
                I decided as my website was going to be a blog that it would be helpful to have everything on the same page.<br>
                This meant I had one page with a lot of content and in order to make it more user friendly I decided to use a jump link for each section of the page.<br>
                I used visual studio code for the actual coding of the website, by using HTML,<br> 
                it allowed me space out sentences properly, assign paragraphs and add bullet points.<br>
                The next step was to add images underneath each paragraph to add some colour to the website.<br>
                Once I had the general lay out of the website and content filled in I could then move to using CSS to style the website,<br> 
                adding background colour and changing the overall look of the website.<br>
                A great place learn how to code in HTML and CSS is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"target="_blank">w3schools</a><br>

                <h4>Copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h4>
            <p>
                Copyright means the right to re-produce work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies,<br>
                to perform the work, and display the work publically.<br>
                If you are using content that has been copyrighted and you don't legally have the right to use the content you can be fined<br>
                A good way to avoid any copy right issues is when using google to find images you can change the settings to filter out copyrighted images.<br>
                When quoting from a website it is always a good idea to include a link to their website as well.<br>

                <h4>How people with disabilities use the web</h4>
                <p>
                People who are blind often use screen readers that reads the text on the screen, or refreshable braile displays,<br> 
                we can help them by using text based browsers rather than graphical browsers.<br>
                However people with low vision can be helped by increasing our text font size and making sure we use colors that stand out,<br> 
                so our text is not similiar to our background.<br>
                The same applies to people with colour blindness, making sure we are not using similar colours as it'll make it difficult for them tl read.<br>
                Seizure disorders can be a common problem when using websites that have flickering gifs or sudden flashes.<br>
                I used still images for this reason rather than moving gifs to make it more accessible.<br>
                Also people with psychriatic disabilities have trouble focusing so I made sure there was no distracting visual or audio elements to my site<br>

                <h4>File types suitable for websites</h4>
                To build the structure of the website and to add content I used HTML.<br>
                To add images to my website I used common image file types to make sure that there was no errors,<br>
                the image types I used was jpeg, png and gif. It's important to use common file types as some can not be supported on websites<br>
                Finally I used CSS to style the website which enabled me to change the alignment, add background colours and change the font.<br>
                <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html#rar" target="_blank">More information on each type can be found here</a><br>

                <h4>Outcome 2</h4><br>
                <p>I found the use of trello extremely helpful as I could store my content there and recover it when needed.<br>
                When starting a new day I can look back on trello to see what tasks have been completed and what is needed to be done,<br>
                this helps alot with planning and time management.<br>
                For the actual coding I used Visual Studio Code which i've found easy to use, the program identifys where you have made mistakes,<br>
                and even in some cases helps you to fix them.
                I found both programs extremely effective and they helped me complete my tasks.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The main strength of my website is that it's simple and easy to use for everyone, the black text is easily readable against the light background,<br>
               which means even people who have visual impairment should be able to read it, I also made the size bigger to help it become clear.<br>
               The main weakness of the website is I feel it could of been more aesthetically pleasing, as I went for simplicity rather than beauty.<br>
               I would most likely change the background to be a scenic image, perhaps have the text in boxes so it looks neater.<br>
               I also would use buttons rather than links as it looks neater, and are more relevant<br>
               Overall I feel the outcome of my website was successful, it's easy to navigate and all information is clearly highlighted and easy to read<br> </p>
            </p>
            <h4>Outcome 3</h4>
            <p>If I was to build the website again I feel I would be more effecient as I now have a better understanding of HTML and CSS.<br>
               I now have a better understanding of where to use div's, paragraphs and line breaks,<br>
               resizing headers and making lists. The draw back to this is it takes time to make sure everything is spaced correctly.<br>
               As for writing I'm used to using Microsoft Word which does everything for you.<br>
               It would of been alot easier to work in teams as my weaknesses or gaps in knowledge could of been someone else's strength.<br>
               In a team we would be able to brainstorm ideas then assign individuals tasks depending on their strengths using trello,<br>
               We could then link trello to slack so we can effectively communicate and receive updates once tasks have been completed.</p>
               When the site has been completed I would then test it on different browsers to make sure its working correctly,<br>
               I would also ask colleagues to test it and note down any feedback given, if it was possible I would also like to see how people with disabilities use the website.<br>
               This would enable me to make it more user friendly if needed.<br>
